# CudaNeuralNetwork
This project is a Fully Connected Neural Network implemented purely in CUDA C.

The neural netrok was trained on [BelgiumTS Dataset](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/) and used for traffic signs classification.

The purpose of this implementation is to gain a peak performance on a single GeForce GTX 1080 Ti card. It achieves 12.42 times speedup in compartion to 8 core CPU implementation.
